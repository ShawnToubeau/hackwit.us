This entry is a personal piece written by Lead Organizer (2018), Ethan Arrowood. He will update this post with all diversity and inclusion efforts the team develops throughout organizing and executing HackWITus 2018.

_July 7th, 2018_

When I took on the responsibility of leading HackWITus' 2018 event planning, I wanted to increase our diversity, accesibility, and inclusion efforts. What I've always heard is that many leaders will say these aspects matter, but when it comes to actually doing something about it they drop the ball. It is my personal goal to not let that happen within the HackWITus organization. 

I developed the first official version of our site and published it so that we could recieve some feedback. Organizers Alyssa and Shawn helped me draft our mission and diversity statements. What we came up with is the following:

> HackWITus is a community oriented organization that aims to make a home for hackers in the Boston area. We strive to create a positive, energetic environment where any student is free to experiment, innovate, and compete with their peers. We believe that by providing the best resources, we ourselves are encouraging our members to reach their full potential. We go to great lengths because we believe students are the true innovators and will make the greatest impact in the world.

> A central goal for HackWITus 2018 is to create a more diverse and inclusive environment for all hackers. In order to achieve our goal, we are taking steps to organize the event in a manner that provides a welcoming and fun experience for all attendees. Some things we have changed already include:
>
> - Removing "Gender" and "Identifiers" on sign-up. We want to include all genders and indetities at our event.
> - Providing gender-neutral bathrooms. There will be at least one gender-neutral bathroom on every floor. We will still provide Male and Female bathrooms for those who wish to use them instead.
> - Translating our material into multiple languages in order to eliminate any sort of language barrier for attendees and sponsors.
> - Collaborating with diversity & inclusion organizations at Wentworth. These organizations inlcude: WILD, WSG, Diversity Center, SWE, NSBE, and more.
> - Establishing relationships with child care and disability services for attendees requiring them.

From this point I asked some developer groups I am apart of to provide feedback on how we are doing thus far. I knew there was plenty of room for improvement.

Naomi Johnson, Sandra Luo, and Reanna Wong (fellow Microsoft interns) provided some incredible feedback; I've simplified their responses into the following 'to-do' list:

- Create a 'one-liner' version of our mission statement and have it displayed within the first section of the site.
- Change first image to something that represents our mission statement (e.g. diversity).
- Display partner organizations in its own section separate from sponsors; display diversity organizations logos!
- Update registration to include gender, nationality, and 'language(s) spoken' fields.
- Remove gender-bias wording from website and other content
- Add a section discussing teamwork.

The first draft of this post was written in coordination with these changes. Everything was merged with pull request (#xx).
